No other file than Interpreter.ts has been added/modified.
Interpreter.ts is able to pass all the tests (including those for the quantifier "all") but the last one.
Except a few import at the beginning of the file, all changes are inside of the interpretCommand function.
This function contains 5 helper functions. They are all documented.
A few comments can also be found in order to make the code more understandable.
